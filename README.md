# Chatbot-as-a-Companion
Final Project for the Building AI Course

## Summary

This project aims to create a chatbot designed to serve as a personal companion. Leveraging the latest advancements in algorithms, the chatbot is intended to offer a supportive and interactive experience for users seeking constant companionship.

## Background

The chatbot addresses issues such as loneliness by providing a reliable conversational partner available 24/7. Users can engage with the bot any day of the week, at any time, ensuring they always have someone to talk to.

## How Is It Used?

The chatbot facilitates a variety of discussions and, over time, learns about its user to tailor its responses and behavior accordingly. Its functionalities include:

* Engaging in conversations and actively listening;
* Adapting to the user's personality and preferences;
* Providing information on social behavior, useful tips, fun facts, weather updates, calendar events, etc.

The chatbot can operate in both text mode (simulating written conversation) and speech mode (similar to a phone call).

## Data Sources and AI Methods

To build an effective chatbot, the project will utilize data for:

* Speech recognition;
* Natural Language Processing (NLP);
* Personalized learning based on user interactions;
* And more.

Data will be sourced from reputable, open-source databases that are current and relevant.

## Challenges

The project faces limitations, such as the chatbot's inability to perform tasks outside its designed capabilities (e.g., writing articles, playing games).

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Future developments may involve integrating a physical robotic structure, which would require additional advancements in movement mechanics, balance, image recognition, and spatial awareness.
